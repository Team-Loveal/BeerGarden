# Beer Garden 🌱
### Grow your relationships over a beer 🍻

###### This was created during our time as students at Code Chrysalis.

Beer Garden is a dating app with a twist ✨ It's an online beer garden where you can meet new people and make wonderful relationships *through conversations rather than by looks*!

Meet a new person everyday with both your photos blurred. As you build your new relationship through conversations, the photos will gradually reveal itself! 🎉

**Find true love ♥️ It all starts with a hearty** ***cheers!***🍻
